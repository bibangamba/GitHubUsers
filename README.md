## Getting Started

Below are instructions to get the app good to run on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installing

* clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/bibangamba/GitHubUsers.git` 
* import the project into android studio
* [create an android virtual device (AVD) and start it](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)
* [run the project](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app) you've imported above

## Running the tests

* In the terminal, run `./gradlew jacocoTestCoverage` to run tests and generate a coverage report

## Built With

* [Android Java](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app/) - Codelab on Java Android
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - IDE
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - HTTP Client for Android
* [Invision](https://invisionapp.com) & [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) - Mock up design tools

## Rationale for choice of mock up design tools
1. I found out that the project I would be working on (Converge Mobile) was using Invision for its 
design mock ups and I wanted to experience using it too.
2. I found that creating an interactive mock up was quite easy on invision once I had designed 
the boards in Sketch
3. Sketch as a design tool was easy to use, quite powerful, and had tons of free icons 
& online support
